# This file has the code needed to process large FOV stack:
# 1. Asses all following:
#   a) stack is of correct type
#   b) only channel 1 saving is enabled
#   c) all rois are in non-discrete plane mode
#   d) all rois have only one scanfield
#   d) all rois are of the same pixel size (scaling would be too much work, plus we don't want to create a mess with resolution)

# 2. Get all above values for the stack (num of planes, etc)
# 3. Asses that tiff size is correct
# 4. If multiple repeats of the stack (volumes) - average them out before stitching
# 5. Preallocated destination tiff:
# 6. Keep track of what output size should be:
# 7. Stitching:
#       For nth z in z array:
#           Load nth page of tiff
#           For each roi in rois:
#               Get roiâ€™s pixel size, and location
#               Get portion of the tiff to insert, inset to location in destination file
